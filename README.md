# Loan-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Description:

This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing loan applications using Logistic Regression. The model will utilize historical loan data, including applicant demographics, financial history, and loan characteristics, to predict the likelihood of loan default.

Key Objectives:

Data preprocessing and cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the loan dataset.
Feature engineering: Select and engineer relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance and interpretability.
Build and train a Logistic Regression model: Develop and train a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on the extracted features.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and1 AUC-ROC. Â  
Analyze model results: Interpret the model coefficients to understand the factors that most significantly influence loan default risk.
Develop a loan risk scoring system: Create a system to assign a risk score to each loan application based on the model's prediction.
Expected Outcomes:

A well-trained Logistic Regression model capable of accurately predicting loan default probabilities.
A set of insights into the key factors driving loan defaults.
A robust loan risk scoring system that can be used to automate loan approval processes and reduce credit risk.
Potential Challenges:

Class imbalance: The dataset may contain a disproportionate number of non-defaulting loans compared to defaulting loans.
Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features from a large dataset can be challenging.
Model interpretability: Interpreting the coefficients of a complex Logistic Regression model can be difficult.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment (optional): Flask, Streamlit
